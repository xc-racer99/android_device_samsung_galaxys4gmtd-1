# init.rc file for GPS: This is here to allow for devices
# to provide their own GPS initialization code without
# conflicting with the default GPS init. (i.e. Vibrant, Galaxy S 4G)
#
# Some files are dummies in that they only exist on certain variants.
# They are only started when they're present; if they're not then its
# a harmless error.
